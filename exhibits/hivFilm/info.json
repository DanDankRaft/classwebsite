    "subheading": "HIV/AIDS in Dallas: An Abridged History of the Fight for Care” is a minidocumentary by Zane Buresh. The film explores the emergence and growth of an infamously deadly disease that devastated America’s gay community in the 1980s–particularly in Dallas. As the local government and Parkland Hospital’s medical officials drag their heels despite the rapidly rising death toll, a grassroots collection of LGBTQ+ activists take charge of their own destinies, deploying whatever drastic and unorthodox measures they can to save themselves and their community.
