    "subheading": "Zines are very important to queer history and counterculture in general. In this project, we examine how queer identity has been expressed through zine culture and take a look at how southern queer folk were able to express themselves through this medium. A zine is a small, self published magazine that has been around for many years, with it being popularized for punk and other countercultures in the 1970s and on. This project examines zines from 80s-early 2000s on queer culture in the south, along with the many facets of oneâ€™s queer identity in the south.",
